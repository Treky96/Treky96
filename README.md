# ContactMe

Created a static website, to make people able to send me an e-mail with a simple contact-formular.
Hosted the website on Github.
Created a QR-Code for the hosted website-link.
Made a QR-Code sticker.
Put this sticker into my car.

I have almost no knowledge about html, github and hosting. But i tried it.
